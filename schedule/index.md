## Week 3 [Jan 29]

#### Monday

* :loudspeaker: Lecture: Lightning Talks Round A - Part 1
  * Speaker order: chosen based on the alphabetical order of last three letters of the full name (as per IVLE), limited to 1-2 students from each team per week.  
    * Week 3: Daniel, Joanne, Vivek, Bao, Dat, Li Hao, Jun Kiat
    * Week 4: Darren, Yan Hwa, Rachael, Shradheya, Jun An, Lechuan, Zhi Yuan
    * Week 5: Nicholas, Chun Rong, Cara, Alex, Lewis, Wen Xin, Haozhe

<panel header="Some things to consider when preparing for the talk" expanded no-close>

<span id="tips-roundA">

Try to follow these steps in this sequence:

  1. **Define the _intended impact_ of the talk.** 
     * Try to choose an impact that has a _do_ component (e.g., `get audience to switch to technology X`), not just _know_ and _believe_ components (e.g., `tell audience about X`). The _do_ component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.
     * Frame the intended impact as a _call-to-action_ (CtA).
  1. **Find a WIIFY** i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this _specific_ audience at a _concrete_ level. 
     For example, explaining `how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now` is better than making a general claim that `Foo is a useful technology`. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>
     If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.
  1. Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points. 
     * We look for **points, not topics** %%e.g., `how to use X` is a topic while `X is easy to use` is a point%%. 
     * Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are `a`, `b`, `c`, you should be able to say "`a`; `b`; `c`; _therefore_, `CtA`" %%e.g., "`X is fast`; `X is free`; `X is getting popular`; _therefore_, switch to X!"%%
  1. Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).
     Roadmap | Key points
     --- | ----
     `What is X`<br> `Demo of X`<br> `Benefits of X` | `X is fast`<br> `X is free`<br> `X is getting popular`
  1. **Find a PUNCH.** This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic %%e.g, if your CtA is `switch to X`, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X%%. 
  1. Design the slide content.
     * One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br>
       Peers reviewing a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.
     * Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
       %%e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:%% 
       >%%There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.%%
     * Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big `Thank You` or `Q&A`)
     * Limit the content to what you can deliver in **7 minutes** (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&A.
  1. **Start the talk with a _PUNCH_, _WIIFY_, and the _Roadmap_**. ==Avoid the traditional `My name is A, my topic is B` type start.==
  1. **End the talk with key points and CtA.** It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points. 

  1. **Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance**.

## Week 7 [Mar 5]

#### Todo

* :alarm_clock: by Monday
  * Peer evaluations
  * Some progress expected on the external project
  
#### Monday

* Teams for 2nd half of the semester:
  * Team 1: Wen Xin, Vivek, Alex, Lechuan, Haozhe
  * Team 2: Rachael, Lewis, Li Hao, Darren
  * Team 3: Joanne, Zhi Yuan, Shradheya, Jun An
  * Team 4: Cara, Daniel, Quoc Bao, Jun Kiat
  * Team 5: Yan Hwa, Nicholas, Chun Rong, Dat

* :loudspeaker: Lightning Talks Round B - Part 1
  * The break-down of rounds B1-3 will be similar to rounds A1-3 i.e., if you presented in round A1 (week 3), you will present in round B1 (week 7).
  * In your slide design and delivery, try to apply the tips covered in week 6 lecture. Some of those points are given in the panel below but you are advised to look at the lecture slides again before you prepare for the talk.
  * In addition, aim for a more emphatic application of tips given for round A (see the panel below for a reference)

<panel header="Tips for round B" expanded no-close>

* **Make slides more visual**:
  * Instead of bullet points, use other suitable visual structures %%e.g., a flow chart%%
  * Instead of text, use graphical forms
  * But avoid visual clutter such as background graphics that do not add value
  
  * :tv: Given below is a video containing some slide design tips:
  
    @[youtube](_bMzItCJWq0)

* **Make the point clear**:
  * Ask yourself "what is the point I want to make in this slide?" Once you have determined the point, ask yourself "can I improve the slide to make the point clearer?"
  * Use _assertion-evidence_ type slides rather that _topic-content_ type where applicable.
  * Ensure every technical term used is either known to the audience or you define it explicitly. If you are not sure if the audience know the definition, _slip in_ the definition casually to your explanations.
  * Demo/describe your solution early to avoid setting expectations too high. %%If you spend a lot of time explaning the problem or criticising competing solutions, audience expectations of your own solution might climb too high.%%

* **Animate meaningfully**: Use animations/transitions to enhance the meaning of your slide content.

* **Use the Click-Look-Recall technique** instead of using cue cards: 
  * Ensure that you know the sequence of your talking points in advance.
  * Map each point to a click on your slide, which should add a visual cue onto the slide that reminds you of the point you are supposed to talk about.
  * During delivery, _look_ at the screen as you _click_, and use the visual cue to _recall_ the point.

## Week 11 [Apr 2]

#### Todo

* Plan to finish ongoing (and new) PRs by end of week 12, with one week to spare. If PRs are stalling due to lack of reviews from mentors, feel free to nag.

* STePS preparations:
  * Start planning the posters. Note that here are some requirements from STePS regarding the poster format (e.g., include some sponsor logos). While STePS let you print the poster for free, you'll have to print it by the schedule they give, and the printing date is likely to be earlier than presentation date. Please get my feedback for the poster before printing it. You can get a copy of the previous year poster from the whoever did the poster last year. As the poster is not graded, it is ok to reuse some of the stuff from the previous year poster, but best not to copy it wholesale. 
  * Submit project info (screenshots, videos etc.) to the STePS website. We want our projects to appear well in the STePS website because our main goal of participating in STePS is to gain exposure for your projects within the industry.

<panel type="danger" header="**Targets for LT Round C**" expanded no-close>

In this round you are ==expected to hit almost all targets(:dart:)== given below. You are recommended to follow tips (:bulb:) given under each target closely.

**Talk structure**

1. :dart: The talk is well-structured and aims for high impact.
   1. :bulb: Document all the important elements of PUMA given below (listed in the order one would define each when planning the talk structure) ==as an extra/hidden slide in the slide deck== (for verification/grading purposes)
      * Intended impact:
         * Know
         * Believe
         * Do
      * WIIFY
      * Key points 
      * Call-to-action
      * Roadmap
      * PUNCH

**Slide design**

1. :dart: No visual clutter
   1. :bulb: Remove any conspicuous background graphics that do not add value
   1. :bulb: Avoid using <tooltip content="done without good reason; uncalled for">gratuitous</tooltip> images that don't really add value
1. :dart: Visual slides
   1. :bulb: Wherever you have bullet points (or paragraph text), look for another suitable structure such as a table, flow chart, map, graph, etc.
   1. :bulb: Use graphics instead of (or in addition to) text
1. :dart: Important elements of the talk are captured prominently in slides
   1. :bulb: Ensure WIIFY, Roadmap, start/end of sections of the Roadmap, and each keypoint are captured as separate slides or as noticeable visual elements
   1. :bulb: Use words `Key point` in text so that they are hard to miss<br>
    %%e.g., `KEY POINT: Java is verbose!`%%
   1. :bulb: use a different (and more prominent) design for important slides and key elements<br>
    %%e.g., use a brighter background, bigger font size%%  
1. :dart: Last slide is used to good effect
   1. :bulb: at least it should contain key points and the call-to-action
   1. :bulb: as the last slide should contain the essence of the talk, it is ok to be 'crowded'
   1. :bulb: you may want to include your contact details in the last slide too
1. :dart: Slides optimized to convey the point, and help your delivery
   1. :bulb: Write down in slide notes the point(s) a slide is supposed to convey. Each slide should have at least a main point, and possibly some sub points. e.g.,
      ```
      Java is still the most popular language today.
      * Java positions lead job vacancies.
      * Highest percentage of devices support JVM.
      * All fortune 500 companies use Java for their enterprise systems.
      ```
   1. :bulb: If possible, use the assertion-evidence format to bring out the main point. i.e., show the main point as the slide title.<br>
    %%e.g., the slide title can be `Java is still the most popular language today.` (i.e., the main point) instead of `Java popularity` (i.e., a phrase/topic)%% 
   1. :bulb: For each sub point, ensure there is a corresponding click.<br> 
    %%e.g., the slide should have at least three clicks so that you can use the click-look-recall technique as a prompt to talk about each of the three sub points.%% 
1. :dart: Minimum use of jargon
   1. :bulb: Format jargon in a different way e.g., use a different font so that you remember to define them. Alternatively, put the definition on the slide.
1. :dart: Meaningful animations
   1. :bulb: Use meaningful slide transitions e.g., use a more drastic transition when moving from one major section to another.
   1. :bulb: When possible, gradually remove/introduce elements into a slide so that the audience can maintain context i.e., minimize drastic change of scenery. 

**Delivery**

1. :dart: Start with a PUNCH (instead of traditional self-intro)
   1. :bulb: Open with a brief greeting, and jump starlight into your PUNCH
1. :dart: WIIFY and Roadmap clearly communicated. 
   1. :bulb: Use clear 'marker' phrases to draw attention to these important elements of the talk. e.g., `"I think this is a very important topic to you because ..."` `"In the next few minutes, I'm going to talk about (a)... (b)... and (c)"`
1. :dart: Each key point is clearly made 
   1. :bulb: When the key slide comes up, use the marker phrase `"So, the key point here is ..."` to draw attention to it.
1. :dart: Finish by reiterating key points, and call-to-action.
   1. :bulb: Follow the call-to-action with a clear `"Thank you!"` and if applicable, `"I'm ready for your questions"` to indicate the end of your talk.
